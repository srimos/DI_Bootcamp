//     Instructions
// Create a variable called sentence. The value of the variable should be a string that contains the words “not” and “bad”.
// For example, “The movie is not that bad, I like it”.

    // let sentence = "This dinner is not that bad ! You cook well"
    // let sentence = "This movie is not so bad!"
    // let sentence = "This dinner is bad!";
    let sentence = "This dinner is good!";

// Create a variable called wordNot where it’s value is the first appearance (ie. the position) of the substring “not” (from the sentence variable).
    let wordNot = sentence.indexOf("not")

// Create a variable called wordBad where it’s value is the first appearance (ie. the position) of the substring “bad” (from the sentence variable).
    let wordBad = sentence.indexOf("bad")
    
// If the word “bad” comes after the word “not”, you should replace the whole “not…bad” substring with “good”, then console.log the result.
// For example, the result here should be : “The movie is good, I like it”
// If the word “bad” does not come after “not” or the words are not in the sentence, console.log the original sentence.
    if (wordBad>wordNot && wordNot != -1 && wordBad != -1) {
        let goodSentence = sentence.replace(sentence.substring(wordNot,wordBad+3),"good")
        console.log(goodSentence)
    } else if (wordBad<=wordNot || wordNot == -1 || wordBad == -1) {
        console.log(sentence)
    }
